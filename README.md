# Stock Insight 📈

Welcome to the **Stock Insight** project, where you can gain valuable insights into stock trends and make informed decisions. This app leverages real-time stock data, technical indicators, and machine learning to help users understand stock market behaviors. It is built using **Streamlit** for the user interface and **Yahoo Finance** for real-time stock data fetching.

- **Technical Indicators**: 
  - **Moving Averages (SMA & EMA)** for trend analysis.
  - **Bollinger Bands** to assess price volatility and potential overbought/oversold conditions.
  - **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** to identify potential overbought or oversold conditions.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Visualize stock trends and technical indicators with **matplotlib**.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with **Streamlit** for a responsive and easy-to-use interface.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive app.
- **Yahoo Finance (yfinance)**: To fetch real-time and historical stock data.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
